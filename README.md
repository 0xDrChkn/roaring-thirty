# Birthday invite and game

A reusable Gatsby birthday website: a cinematic invitation and a playable host-controlled TV party game. Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, served directly by GitHub Pages. No build step. A small Node.js service can store private replies and photos on an always-on Mac mini; no cloud database account is required.

**[Open the invitation](https://0xdrchkn.github.io/roaring-thirty/)** · **[Play the game](https://0xdrchkn.github.io/roaring-thirty/game/)**

## Start it on the Mac mini

Tailscale is already in use. On the Mini, clone/open this repo, make sure Node.js 24+ and Tailscale are running, then run:

```sh
./start-mac-mini.sh
```

This installs/updates the service, preserves stored replies, detects the Mini’s Tailscale address, and enables a persistent Funnel for the invitation. It avoids other existing Tailscale web routes. If Tailscale asks for Funnel permission, finish that prompt and rerun if necessary.

The launcher checks a disposable RSVP, story and photo through HTTPS, verifies organiser access and the downloaded photo, then removes the test. It prints the invitation, organiser and game links, plus the location of your private organiser login. **The actual Mini and an off-network phone check are still required before launch.**

To retain the GitHub Pages share link, commit and push the generated `hosting-config.js` from the Mini after the check passes; the launcher prints the exact commands. This file contains only the public URL. See [the short handoff](START-HERE-MAC-MINI.md) and [installation/recovery details](docs/MAC-MINI.md).

## Current celebration

Sara Matilda Berner · 30 · 14 November 2026, 19:00 Europe/Oslo

Nedre Løkka Cocktailbar, Thorvald Meyers gate 89, 0550 Oslo, Norway

“Reliving your twenties” / “Tjueårene om igjen”

The invitation has English and Norwegian Bokmål, a full-castle opening that fits the complete photograph on every screen, a scroll-driven approach through its open doorway, and one Sara greeting. Four separate chapters follow: time/location, name and RSVP, evidence after replying, and the photo album. Dress code and drinks open in focused dialogs. The programme is a surprise and is not published. The drinks copy references Norway’s historical spirits ban; see [the source note](docs/COPY-SOURCES.md). Mobile layouts and reduced-motion preferences are supported. Each chapter fades and rises into view with scrolling. The nine selected album photographs appear across three pages. Guests can skip the entrance.

**The custom RSVP, story/photo form and private organiser work with the new Mac-hosted service.** The local browser flow and storage tests pass; deployment to the actual Mac mini and a stable public HTTPS connection are still pending. Public GitHub Pages submissions remain disabled until that connection is verified. The website does not embed Tally.

The [organiser dashboard](https://0xdrchkn.github.io/roaring-thirty/organiser/) shows attendance, optional emails, stories and photo downloads, with search, filters and CSV export. See [Mac mini installation and backups](docs/MAC-MINI.md), [current verification](docs/INVITATION-READINESS.md), and [the local demo](docs/LOCAL-TEST.md).

The [TV game](https://0xdrchkn.github.io/roaring-thirty/game/) supports 2–6 teams, any chosen categories from a bank of 22, 106 ready clues, the two selected Sara reactions, a configurable timer, plus/minus scoring, corrections, undo, private pack import/export and local saving. The recommended board has 30 ready clues. Four personal slots still need genuine material. The celebrity round has sixteen face blends and a five-portrait picker, and play follows team order with automatic timers and one-use Double Up, First Letter and Steal per round. Correct and Wrong both take the tile immediately and advance the turn; Undo restores the score, tile and turn. See [game usage](game/README.md), [the specification and reference comparison](docs/GAME-SPEC.md), and [category briefs](docs/GAME-CATEGORIES.md).

The approved category update rebuilds **Brand New** as **Started Somewhere Else** and strengthens **Finish the Lyric** and **Emoji Cinema**. The country column is now **Where Are We?**, using five real stationary photo drops and country-only answers. All categories remain selectable; the default category IDs and tournament setup are unchanged.

## Use it for another person

1. Duplicate this repository (the GitHub “Use this template” button), or clone it into a new repository.
2. Edit **[event-config.js](event-config.js)**. Change `id`, `person`, `event`, `heroPhoto` and `photos`. The same config controls the title, date, address, directions, portraits and translated person references. There is no guest list in this file.
3. Replace the pictures in `assets/` and update their paths, captions and descriptive alt text. The photo album automatically groups any number of photos into pages of three. An empty list hides it.
4. Edit `hero` and `copy` for different party wording/themes. `{name}`, `{fullName}` and `{age}` are replaced automatically. Text is inserted as text, not HTML. `hero.headline` supports individual lines and emphasis.
5. Optionally choose `appearance.direction`: `gala` (black and gold), `speakeasy` (emerald), or `champagne` (light). Change `defaultLanguage` to `en` or `nb`.
6. Configure background music below. Enable GitHub Pages from **main / root** in the new repository’s Settings → Pages.
7. Install a separate local service for the new event using the setup options in [MAC-MINI.md](docs/MAC-MINI.md), with its own data directory, event ID and port. Configure a verified HTTPS endpoint in `submissions`. Do not reuse another event’s guest database.

The built-in mansion entrance and Gatsby copy are themed assets. For a completely different theme, update `cinema.css`, `cinema.js`, the mansion image and the translated hero/copy alongside the person settings. All web paths are relative so project URLs work.

## Background music

The visible Spotify embed has been removed to keep attention on the guest of honour. `music.js` provides an invisible HTML audio player with a small sound-on/off control, looping playback and a remembered mute preference per event. It tries autoplay, then retries after an ordinary click or Enter/Space if the browser blocks sound. Manual mute is respected.

**The chosen recording, “Young and Beautiful” by Lana Del Rey, is not included. Music is silent until an audio source is supplied.** Add an audio file you have permission to host (for example `assets/soundtrack.mp3`), then set `music.src` to that path in `event-config.js`. A direct permitted audio URL also works; a Spotify/YouTube page URL is not an audio file. No artist label, cover art or third-party player appears on the invitation. The sound button remains hidden when no source is configured.

Autoplay with sound is subject to browser rules and cannot be guaranteed on first arrival; see [MDN’s autoplay guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Autoplay).

## Local preview

```sh
python3 -m http.server 49174 --bind 127.0.0.1

Open `http://127.0.0.1:49174/`. Run syntax checks with:

```sh
node --check event-config.js
node --check script.js
node --check music.js
node --check cinema.js
node --check story.js
node --check submissions.js
node --check local-submissions.js
node --check organiser/organiser.js
```

- `organiser/`: authenticated reply and memory dashboard.
- `tests/`: local service, installer/recovery and game checks.
- `backend/`, `supabase/`: preserved legacy local-demo backend; not needed for the new Mac installation.

These event details and published images are public on GitHub Pages; `noindex` discourages indexing but does not restrict access. Keep private guest responses, unreleased stories, private game answers and credentials out of this repository. The current game pack contains public rehearsal answers. Do not reuse Sara’s personal photos for a different birthday.
