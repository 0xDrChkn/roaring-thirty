# The Sara Show — content and source notes

Updated 22 September 2026. `game/pack.js` contains **10 categories × 5 clues: 42 playable clues and 8 personal drafts**. All questions and answers have English and Norwegian Bokmål text. Six complete categories are selected by default (30 playable clues); four other categories are available in the bank.

The eight drafts are `bg-200` through `bg-500` (celebrity mashups) and `sa-200` through `sa-500` (personal stories). They must remain unavailable until the host supplies reviewed material. No personal facts, celebrity blends or guest stories were invented to fill these slots.

## Content format

`window.BIRTHDAY_GAME_PACK` contains `id`, localized `title` / `subtitle`, `defaultCategoryIds`, `categories` and `reactions`. Category IDs are stable; the new IDs are `name-that-tune`, `before-or-after`, `party-science` and `the-impostor`.

Each category has an ID, localized title/description and five clues, worth 100–500. A clue has `id`, `value`, localized `question` / `answer`, optional `image` / `imageAlt`, and `draft: true` when unfinished. Localized text is `{ en, nb }`. Accepted title/spelling variants are included in the answer text. Source notes stay in this document so they do not reveal answers on the television.

The unchanged pack ID is `sara-rehearsal-v1`; the engine’s content fingerprint detects edits, so an old saved game cannot silently reuse scores against changed questions. Select a new game when changing the bank. Category selection, scoring and timers belong to the game controls, not the pack.

## Assets and selected reactions

Only the host’s two chosen reaction faces are active:

| Result | Asset | Supplied original |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Correct | `game/assets/reaction-02.webp` | Pink-sweater pose, originally `sticker5.webp`. |
| Wrong | `game/assets/reaction-06.webp` | Sceptical face, originally `sticker3.webp`. |

Other previously copied stickers remain on disk but are not selected by `pack.reactions`. The WebPs are static; the interface animates them. The outcome assignments are creative choices, not claims about Sara’s feelings in the original photographs.

Existing picture clues:

- `clue-bg-100.jpg`: Sara’s approved Gatsby toast recreation. The actor answer follows the host’s explicit Leonardo DiCaprio reference; it is not a real scene of Sara acting in the film.
- `clue-sa-100.jpg`: the table-tennis action photo explicitly identified by the host as Sara’s ping-pong days. No year, tournament, ranking or award is inferred.

Five new local SVGs use [Natural Earth’s 1:110m country polygons](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/master/geojson/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geojson), whose [terms place the data in the public domain](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/). These are simplified geographic outlines, not generated guesses. North stays up; longitude is scaled by the cosine of the view’s mean latitude before fitting the frame. SVG titles, filenames and visible text do not contain answers.

| Asset | Geographic content |
| --- | --- |
| `clue-geo-100.svg` | Italy, including Sicily and Sardinia. |
| `clue-geo-200.svg` | France’s European area, including Corsica; overseas polygons excluded. The question says “European territory”. |
| `clue-geo-300.svg` | Japan’s islands present at the dataset’s coarse scale. |
| `clue-geo-400.svg` | Iceland. |
| `clue-geo-500.svg` | New Zealand’s main islands in gold, Australia in grey; a regional view rather than a claim to show all outlying territories. |

## Fact-check references

These are host notes, not text to read out during the game. Questions use original wording; no song recordings, lyrics, movie stills or celebrity portraits were downloaded for the new categories. Existing film/cast/history sources are retained below; the expanded music, chronology, science, sport and outsider facts were checked against the linked primary sources on 22 September 2026.

### Famous Saras

- `fs-100`, Sarah Jessica Parker / Carrie Bradshaw: [Warner Bros. Discovery cast announcement](https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/hbo-max-releases-and-just-first-look-image-production-begins-nyc).
- `fs-200`, Sarah Michelle Gellar / television Buffy: [Disney+ series page](https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-f2c277c5-62b4-417c-b277-8435b70176dd). The clue distinguishes the television role from the earlier film.
- `fs-300`, Sara Bareilles / Love Song and Brave: [Sara Bareilles’ official documentary page](https://sarabmusic.com/pages/goodgriefdoc) names both songs.
- `fs-400`, Sarah Connor / Linda Hamilton: [Paramount’s Terminator: Dark Fate page](https://www.paramountpictures.com/movies/terminator-dark-fate).
- `fs-500`, Sarah Sjöström’s two Paris 2024 freestyle golds: [Swedish Olympic Committee athlete results](https://sok.se/idrottare/idrottare/s/sarah-sjostrom.html) lists first place at both 50 m and 100 m. The surname is enough; alternative Latin spellings are accepted.

### Geography and capitals

The silhouettes are derived from the country-labelled Natural Earth data above. The two-part final answer (New Zealand + Wellington) is confirmed by [Tourism New Zealand](https://www.newzealand.com/nz/feature/wellington-attractions/). No claim is made about precise coastline resolution or every offshore island being visible.

The Impostor’s capital clue uses [Tourism Australia — Australian Capital Territory](https://www.australia.com/en-gb/places/australian-capital-territory.html), [City of Ottawa](https://ottawa.ca/en/business/economic-development-services/economic-development/why-ottawa) and Tourism New Zealand. Sydney is the sole non-capital among the four options.

### The Roaring Twenties

- `rt-100`, Charleston: [Library of Congress — flappers](https://guides.loc.gov/chronicling-america-flappers).
- `rt-200`, speakeasy: [The Mob Museum’s Prohibition history](https://prohibition.themobmuseum.org/the-history/the-prohibition-underworld/the-speakeasies-of-the-1920s/).
- `rt-300`, talkies: [Library of Congress — sound in film](https://loc.gov/loc/lcib/08012/silent.html).
- `rt-400`, Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel: [Library of Congress — America Reads](https://loc.gov/exhibits/america-reads/1900-to-1949.html).
- `rt-500`, Norway’s spirits ban: [FHI historical overview](https://www.fhi.no/le/alkohol/alkoholinorge/alkohol-i-historien/historisk-oversikt-alkohol-i-norge-1816-2019/). Referendum: 1926; formal repeal: 1927. The fortified-wine ban ended separately in 1923. A “bootlegger licence” is not taught as historical fact.

### Bad Movie Plots

The descriptions are original comic paraphrases. Title variants in English/Norwegian are acceptable.

- `mp-100`, Titanic: [Paramount synopsis](https://www.paramountpictures.com/movies/titanic).
- `mp-200`, Home Alone: [20th Century Studios synopsis](https://family.20thcenturystudios.com/movies/home-alone).
- `mp-300`, Jurassic Park: [Universal synopsis and 1993 release](https://www.universalpicturesathome.com/movies/jurassic-park).
- `mp-400`, Finding Nemo: [Pixar’s story and character page](https://www.pixar.com/finding-nemo).
- `mp-500`, Inception: [Warner Bros. film page](https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/inception). The clue describes planting an idea inside dreams, rather than confusing it with stealing one. The prior research browser did not expose this page’s synopsis text.

### Name That Tune

This is a text-recognition category; no music playback is necessary and none is claimed.

- `nt-100`, Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen (1975): [Queen’s official history](https://www.queenonline.com/queen) and [Library of Congress recording essay](https://lcweb2.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/Bohemian-Rhapsody_Breithaupt.pdf).
- `nt-200`, Dancing Queen, ABBA (1976): [ABBA’s official song history](https://abbasite.com/articles/dancing-queen/). The clue is a description of the title, not a quoted lyric.
- `nt-300`, …Baby One More Time: [Britney Spears’ official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4) and [official release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Niv2q4gvc). The school-corridor clue refers to the music video; no age guess is involved.
- `nt-400`, Take On Me: [a-ha’s official account of the pencil-sketch/live-action video](https://www.staging.a-ha.com/news/a-ha-reaches-one-billion-views-with-take-on-me).
- `nt-500`, Viva La Vida: [Coldplay’s account of the Kahlo painting that inspired the album name](https://timeline.coldplay.com/article/latin-america-tour/) and the [2008 single release](https://www.coldplay.com/release/viva-la-vida/). Song and album share the title.

### Before or After?

Every question specifies the event being compared. The country matters for release dates; the pack explicitly uses Japan for PlayStation and US cinemas for Toy Story. Teams only need “before” or “after”, not both dates.

| ID | Correct comparison | Sources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ba-100` | Shrek (2001) before the first iPhone unveiling (9 January 2007). | [DreamWorks](https://www.dreamworks.com/movies/shrek), [Apple announcement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/01/09Apple-Reinvents-the-Phone-with-iPhone/). |
| `ba-200` | Google incorporation (4 September 1998) after Titanic (1997). | [Google’s company account](https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/company-announcements/marking-20ish-years-google/), [Paramount Titanic](https://www.paramountpictures.com/movies/titanic). The clue asks incorporation, not the start of the research project. |
| `ba-300` | Toy Story (22 November 1995) after Japanese PlayStation launch (3 December 1994). | [Pixar history](https://www.pixar.com/our-story), [PlayStation’s timeline](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-history/1994-ps-one/). |
| `ba-400` | First SMS (December 1992) before Jurassic Park (1993). | [Vodafone’s first-message account](https://www.vodafone.com/news/newsroom/technology/25-anniversary-text-message), [Universal](https://www.universalpicturesathome.com/movies/jurassic-park). |
| `ba-500` | Windows 95 on sale (24 August 1995) before Toy Story in US cinemas (22 November 1995). | [Microsoft anniversary](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/08/24/looking-back-the-25th-anniversary-of-windows-95/), [Pixar history](https://www.pixar.com/our-story). |

### Hold My Drink

- `ps-100`, carbon dioxide in sparkling wine: [Champagne research published by the American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/avweb/1c2web3536/champagnepouring.pdf).
- `ps-200`, condensation on a cold glass: [US Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/water-science-school/science/condensation-and-water-cycle).
- `ps-300`, melting floating ice in plain water: [NASA’s explanation](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/news/261/melting-ocean-ice-affects-sea-level-unlike-ice-cubes-in-a-glass/). The question explicitly excludes evaporation/thermal expansion and does not generalise the result to fresh ice floating in salt water.
- `ps-400`, chilled sparkling wine retains more gas when poured: the [ACS research paper](https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/avweb/1c2web3536/champagnepouring.pdf) compares temperature-dependent CO₂ losses. This is about gas retention, not health or alcohol effects.
- `ps-500`, topspin: [NASA Glenn’s spinning-ball force explanation](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/lift-of-a-baseball/) and [curveball pressure explanation](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/FoilSim/Manual/fsim000x.htm). Applying the stated spin/flow relationship to topspin gives the downward aerodynamic force in the clue. The direction, not the term “Magnus effect”, earns the points.

### The Impostor

- `im-100`, Bond actors: [official 007 film catalogue](https://www.007.com/the-films/). Matt Damon’s Bourne role is confirmed by [Universal](https://www.universalpictures.com/movies/jason-bourne).
- `im-200`, capitals: see Geography and capitals above.
- `im-300`, Nobel fields: [Nobel Prize organisation](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/). Mathematics is not a listed prize category. No speculative story about why is included.
- `im-400`, coastlines: [Portugal’s national tourism organisation](https://www.visitportugal.com/en/content/beaches) identifies its coast as Atlantic. Italy, Greece and Egypt have Mediterranean coastlines in the Natural Earth geography above.
- `im-500`, Champagne’s three main grapes: [Comité Champagne](https://www.champagne.fr/en/about-champagne/a-great-blended-wine/champagne-and-its-grape-varieties). The wording says “main”, not “only”, because other varieties are authorised too. Merlot is the outsider among the four options.

## Limits

The public static pack exposes its answers in source code. It is rehearsal content, not a protected party vault. Real guest stories and unrevealed final assets belong in a private host pack. The two personal columns still need eight completed entries; this expansion does not claim to have generated their missing images or obtained personal answers. Difficulty and name recognition should be rehearsed with this particular guest group.


## Open knowledge update — 2 October 2026

True/False was replaced by Science + Tech, and Before/After by Time Machine (open year questions using the chronology sources above). Condensation and Magnus-effect clues now ask for the process/effect directly. The recommended board is Sara celebrity pictures, country pictures, bad film plots, music, Science + Tech and Typically Norwegian.

Science + Tech sources, checked for the party plan:

- st-100 Mars: [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/mars/).
- st-200 carbon dioxide/photosynthesis: [NASA carbon cycle](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-observatory/the-carbon-cycle/).
- st-300 Au/gold: [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/79/gold).
- st-400 central processing unit: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/central-processing-unit).
- st-500 light-year: [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/).

The [party plan](PARTY-GAME-PLAN.md) records bilingual clue drafts, answer variants, timing assumptions and research limits. Old category inventories earlier in this file describe the September pack.


## Approved category upgrades — 2 October 2026

Started Somewhere Else rebuilds Brand New while retaining `brand-new` and `br-100`–`br-500`. The five answers are Nintendo, Lamborghini, Michelin, Nokia and Post-it notes. The implemented bilingual questions paraphrase primary company histories; source links and accepted-answer boundaries are recorded in [STARTED-SOMEWHERE-ELSE.md](STARTED-SOMEWHERE-ELSE.md).

Finish the Lyric and Emoji Cinema remain selectable with revised clues and host guidance. The 22-category count, default categories and tournament logic are unchanged. Earlier inventory/source notes describe previous clue versions; the new category records below take precedence for these three columns.

- [FINISH-THE-LYRIC.md](FINISH-THE-LYRIC.md) records short contiguous cuts, required word counts, judging rules and verification sources. Both languages use the same English lyric and translated instructions; audio is not required.
- [EMOJI-CINEMA.md](EMOJI-CINEMA.md) records original Unicode arrangements, accepted English/Norwegian titles, explanations and film sources. The upper clues use plot connections, and none repeats the current Bad Movie Plots answers.

Where Are We? supersedes the old silhouette geography set. Five licensed real photographs are locally served at fixed viewpoints; the same five are used on each new game. Country-only answers replace the old New Zealand-and-capital requirement. [GEO-LOCATIONS.md](GEO-LOCATIONS.md) records exact assets, locations, photographers, original sources, licences, resize history and hashes; [the public credit page](../game/location-credits.html) and [`geo-location-credits.json`](../game/assets/geo-location-credits.json) accompany the images. The older SVG silhouettes remain archived assets, not active clues. No Street View service, walking controls or runtime global randomness is implied.
